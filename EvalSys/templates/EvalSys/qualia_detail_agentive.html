			<strong>Instructions: </strong> <br>
			Does the description in the second row seem like a reasonable origin for the entity in row 1? Is it how the entity comes about? (If you don't know the entity, row 3 is the definition that might help your judgement.) <br>
			By default, judgment forms are populated with "idk". You need to change this like this: <br>
			If reasonable, type <strong>r</strong>. If unreasonable, type <strong>u</strong>. If you're not sure or you don't know, type <strong>ns</strong>. <br>
			If you feel it's reasonable but that's not how you put it, then make a comment in the comment box.
		</p>

			<strong>Warning:</strong> <br>
			The values are automatically extracted from an ontology. Expect to see some not everyday English.
