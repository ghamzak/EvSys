While they are commonly associated with irregular military forces and rioters, they are actually more frequently used for basic arson[citation needed].  In urban slang, they are often referred to as a homemade frag or the poor man's hand grenade.  A Molotov cocktail consists of a glass bottle partly filled with flammable liquid, typically petrol, alcohol, methanol or ethanol.  The mouth of the bottle is stopped up with a cork or other type of airtight bung, made of rubber, glass, or plastic, and an igniter, such as cloth rag is fixed securely around the mouth.  The weapon is used by first soaking the rag in a flammable liquid immediately prior to using it, lighting the rag, and throwing the bottle at the target.  The bottle shatters on impact, spilling the flammable liquid over the target, which is then ignited by the burning rag.  There are also sophisticated methods for igniting, such as use of pyrophoric mass Bengal fire or a chemical igniter based on reaction of sulfuric acid and potassium chlorate, which do not need an external source of fire to work. Additional substances may be added to the basic Molotov cocktail to enhance its use as a weapon.  Molotov cocktails are similar to napalm bombs in principle.  Napalm was originally made by combining flammable naphthalene and petrol with a thickening agent palmitic acid, the latter two being the main ingredients of Molotov cocktails.

While they are commonly associated with irregular military forces and rioters, they are actually more frequently used for basic arson[citation needed].  In urban slang, they are often referred to as a homemade frag or the poor man's hand grenade.  A Molotov cocktail consists of a glass bottle partly filled with flammable liquid, typically petrol, alcohol, methanol or ethanol.  The mouth of the bottle is stopped up with a cork or other type of airtight bung, made of rubber, glass, or plastic, and an igniter, such as cloth rag is fixed securely around the mouth.  The weapon is used by first soaking the rag in a flammable liquid immediately prior to using it, lighting the rag, and throwing the bottle at the target.  The bottle shatters on impact, spilling the flammable liquid over the target, which is then ignited by the burning rag.  There are also sophisticated methods for igniting, such as use of pyrophoric mass Bengal fire or a chemical igniter based on reaction of sulfuric acid and potassium chlorate, which do not need an external source of fire to work. Additional substances may be added to the basic Molotov cocktail to enhance its use as a weapon.  Molotov cocktails are similar to napalm bombs in principle.  Napalm was originally made by combining flammable naphthalene and petrol with a thickening agent palmitic acid, the latter two being the main ingredients of Molotov cocktails.  When gasoline is used as the main ingredient, motor oil or sugar is commonly added to help the gasoline cling to the target.

This can be either a human gunner aiming a sight on the target (remotely from the missile or an automatic tracker. Automatic trackers use radiation emanating from the target or emitted from the launch platform and reflecting back to it from the target. Passive automatic trackers use the target's inherent radiation, usually heat or light, but missiles designed to attack Command & Control posts, aircraft or guided missiles may look for radio waves. Active automatic trackers rely on the target being illuminated by radiation. The target can be painted with light (sometimes infrared and/or laser or radio waves (radar which can be detected by the missile. The radiation for the painting can originate in the missile itself or may come from a remote station (for example, a hilltop gunner can illuminate a target with a laser device and this can be used to direct an air launched guided missile. A guidance system takes data from the missile's tracking system and flight system and computes a flight path for the missile designed to intercept the target. It produces commands for the flight system. The flight system causes the missile to maneuver. There are two main systems: vectored thrust (for missiles that are powered throughout the guidance phase of their flight and aerodynamic maneuvering (wings, fins, canards, etc. There are some similarities between guided missiles and guided bombs. A guided bomb, dropped from an aircraft, is unpowered and uses aerodynamic fins for forward horizontal maneuvering while falling vertically.

This force is applied typically to pistons, turbine blades, or a nozzle. This force moves the component over a distance, transforming chemical energy into useful mechanical energy.   The term internal combustion engine usually refers to an engine in which combustion is intermittent, such as the more familiar four-stroke and two-stroke piston engines, along with variants, such as the six-stroke piston engine and the Wankel rotary engine.

This force is applied typically to pistons, turbine blades, or a nozzle. This force moves the component over a distance, transforming chemical energy into useful mechanical energy.   The term internal combustion engine usually refers to an engine in which combustion is intermittent, such as the more familiar four-stroke and two-stroke piston engines, along with variants, such as the six-stroke piston engine and the Wankel rotary engine. A second class of internal combustion engines use continuous combustion: gas turbines, jet engines and most rocket engines, each of which are internal combustion engines on the same principle as previously described.

This force is applied typically to pistons, turbine blades, or a nozzle. This force moves the component over a distance, transforming chemical energy into useful mechanical energy.   The term internal combustion engine usually refers to an engine in which combustion is intermittent, such as the more familiar four-stroke and two-stroke piston engines, along with variants, such as the six-stroke piston engine and the Wankel rotary engine. A second class of internal combustion engines use continuous combustion: gas turbines, jet engines and most rocket engines, each of which are internal combustion engines on the same principle as previously described.

The Mk 19 fires 40mm grenades at a cyclic rate of 300 to 400 rounds per minute, giving a practical rate of fire of 60 rpm (rapid and 40 rpm (sustained.  The weapon operates on the blowback principle, which uses the chamber pressure from each fired round to load and re-cock the weapon.  The Mk 19 is able to lob its grenade at a maximum distance of 2.2km, though its effective range is about 1.6km.  The nearest safe distance to launch the grenade is 75 meters.  In addition, the Mk 19's flash suppressor and its lack of smoke during firing makes it difficult for enemies to spot and counter it.  For night operation, an AN/TVS-5 night vision sight can be fitted.  The Mk 19 is a man-portable crew-served weapon that can fire from a tripod mounted position or from a vehicle mount (this being the preferred method as the weapon alone weighs 33 kg. The primary ammunition for Mk 19 is the high explosive dual-purpose M430 grenade.  Upon impact, the grenade can kill anyone within the radius of five meters, and wound them within the radius of 15 meters.  It can also punch through two inches of armour, which means it can take out most infantry fighting vehicles and armoured personnel carriers.  It is especially deadly when used against enemy infantry formations.  The ammunition comes in 32 or 48 round cans weighing 42 and 60 lb (20 and 30 kg.  Due to its low recoil and comparatively light weight, it has been adapted for use on many different platforms, including small attack boats, fast attack vehicles such as the Humvee (HMMWV and Stryker, military jeeps and as well as a large variety of naval mounts.

This force is applied typically to pistons, turbine blades, or a nozzle. This force moves the component over a distance, transforming chemical energy into useful mechanical energy.   The term internal combustion engine usually refers to an engine in which combustion is intermittent, such as the more familiar four-stroke and two-stroke piston engines, along with variants, such as the six-stroke piston engine and the Wankel rotary engine. A second class of internal combustion engines use continuous combustion: gas turbines, jet engines and most rocket engines, each of which are internal combustion engines on the same principle as previously described.

While they are commonly associated with irregular military forces and rioters, they are actually more frequently used for basic arson[citation needed].  In urban slang, they are often referred to as a homemade frag or the poor man's hand grenade.  A Molotov cocktail consists of a glass bottle partly filled with flammable liquid, typically petrol, alcohol, methanol or ethanol.  The mouth of the bottle is stopped up with a cork or other type of airtight bung, made of rubber, glass, or plastic, and an igniter, such as cloth rag is fixed securely around the mouth.  The weapon is used by first soaking the rag in a flammable liquid immediately prior to using it, lighting the rag, and throwing the bottle at the target.  The bottle shatters on impact, spilling the flammable liquid over the target, which is then ignited by the burning rag.  There are also sophisticated methods for igniting, such as use of pyrophoric mass Bengal fire or a chemical igniter based on reaction of sulfuric acid and potassium chlorate, which do not need an external source of fire to work. Additional substances may be added to the basic Molotov cocktail to enhance its use as a weapon.  Molotov cocktails are similar to napalm bombs in principle.  Napalm was originally made by combining flammable naphthalene and petrol with a thickening agent palmitic acid, the latter two being the main ingredients of Molotov cocktails.  When gasoline is used as the main ingredient, motor oil or sugar is commonly added to help the gasoline cling to the target.

This force is applied typically to pistons, turbine blades, or a nozzle. This force moves the component over a distance, transforming chemical energy into useful mechanical energy.   The term internal combustion engine usually refers to an engine in which combustion is intermittent, such as the more familiar four-stroke and two-stroke piston engines, along with variants, such as the six-stroke piston engine and the Wankel rotary engine. A second class of internal combustion engines use continuous combustion: gas turbines, jet engines and most rocket engines, each of which are internal combustion engines on the same principle as previously described.
